# 🏡 Structify Estate

A sleek one-page real estate web app that lets users browse, filter, view details, and save dream homes — all powered by a local JSON server backend.

## 📖 Description

Structify Estate is a front-end JavaScript project built as the Phase 1 Final for Moringa School.  
It allows users to:

- View a collection of beautiful homes
- Filter by home type (Apartment, Maisonette, Bungalow, Bedsitter)
- View individual home details
- Save homes to a favourites list

All data is fetched asynchronously from a local JSON server using `fetch()` and rendered dynamically.

## 🚀 Live Demo

🛠️ Make sure you’ve also started the backend with JSON Server to see full functionality.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **HTML** — single-page layout
- **CSS** — styled with a fresh blue theme + animated hero
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — DOM manipulation, filtering, and event handling
- **JSON Server** — mock API to simulate a backend
